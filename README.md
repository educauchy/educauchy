I'm a data scientist working in consulting. Have an experience in fullstack web development / software engineering and business intelligence data analytics.

As a data scientist, I'm interested in A/B-testing, marketing and retail-related problems.
As a person, I love running :running:.

Currently mostly work with Python :snake: and SQL.
